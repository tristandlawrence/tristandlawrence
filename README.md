- 👋 Hi, I’m @tristandlawrence
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, data analytics and science, as well as automating manual work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whether I want to use Github proactively, or just to look at other people's code 👀
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cyber security and compliance automation, and using data analytics to do that efficiently. That, and helping people collaborate.
